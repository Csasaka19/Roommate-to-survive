# Portfolio project for ALX SE

This is the last segment of the ALX SE foundations where peers are required to partner to make a comprehensive project that combines the concepts that were taught during the foundations period.
We decided to make a website which allows people who have apartments or a spacious place to reside to have "roommates" based on location to help solve housing issues experienced in our countries.
